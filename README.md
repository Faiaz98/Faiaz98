## Hey there👋, I'm Faiaz

I'm a **Frontend Developer** who loves building responsive, scalable, and performant web apps with **React**, **TypeScript**, and a sprinkle of UI finesse.

🔍 I also write **dev-focused articles** on my blog [`useFaiaz()`](https://usefaiaz.hashnode.dev), breaking down real-world frontend challenges, modern React patterns, and how not to lose your mind while typing async code.
